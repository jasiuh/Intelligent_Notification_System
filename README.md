# Intelligent_Notification_System
An intelligent fault detection system to be used for fault detection and notification of three-phase input power.
Initially, a data acquisition system is developed in order to acquire current values for six different lines which power an industrial furnace. Fault situations are simulated during acquisition in order to obtain a complete dataset with instances of normal situations as well as fault situations. Two machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree, are then explored in order to determine which best is able to classify potential fault instances. The more efficient algorithm is then loaded into a Raspberry Pi which will be implemented into the current manufacturing process. The Pi will monitor the input power and upon any detected faults, an alarm will be activated and a Short Message Service (SMS) will be sent to maintenance personnel.
